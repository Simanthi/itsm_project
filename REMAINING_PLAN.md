# Remaining Frontend Test Plan & Progress Summary

This document outlines the remaining frontend tests to be implemented and summarizes the progress made so far, particularly focusing on the `PurchaseOrderDetailView.tsx` tests which were just completed.

## Current Overall Progress (High-Level)

*   **Backend Tests:** All backend tests (133) are passing. Initial migration issues and hardcoded test values were addressed. Some empty `tests.py` files remain for backend apps but are not the current focus.
*   **Frontend Tests (General):**
    *   **Procurement Module (Lists & Forms):** Comprehensive tests exist and pass for `PurchaseRequestMemoList`, `PurchaseOrderList`, `CheckRequestList`, and their corresponding forms (`PurchaseRequestMemoForm`, `PurchaseOrderForm`, `CheckRequestForm`). Also, `AssetList` and `AssetForm` tests are passing.
    *   **Utilities & Core UI:** Tests for `useDebounce`, `formatters.ts`, `NotFoundPage.tsx` are passing.
    *   **Authentication:** `LoginPage.tsx` and `AuthContext.tsx` tests are passing (AuthContext required some fixes to the context itself).
    *   **MUI/Vite Blocker:** A persistent MUI styles import error with Vite blocks testing for `App.tsx`, `ServiceRequestsPage.tsx`, and `ServiceRequestForm.tsx`. This needs to be addressed, potentially as a separate, dedicated task.
    *   **Procurement Detail Views:**
        *   `PurchaseRequestMemoDetailView.tsx`: All 11 tests are passing.
        *   `PurchaseOrderDetailView.tsx`: All 8 tests (covering loading, errors, not found, happy path full data display, and navigation) are passing.

## Summary of `PurchaseOrderDetailView.tsx` Tests (Completed in last session)

*   **File:** `itsm_frontend/src/modules/procurement/components/purchase-orders/PurchaseOrderDetailView.tsx`
*   **Test File:** `itsm_frontend/src/modules/procurement/components/purchase-orders/PurchaseOrderDetailView.test.tsx`
*   **Status:** All 8 tests implemented are PASSING.
*   **Tests Cover:**
    1.  Loading state.
    2.  Error state: PO ID missing.
    3.  Error state: PO ID not a number.
    4.  Error state: API call failure.
    5.  Not found state: API returns no PO.
    6.  Successful data display: Renders all PO details with a full data object, including header, vendor, addressing, attachments, order items table, summary, and notes.
    7.  Navigation: "Back" button functionality.
    8.  Navigation: "Print PO" button functionality.
*   **Key Fixes During Testing:**
    *   Initial setup of mocks for `useParams`, `useNavigate`, `getPurchaseOrderById`, and `AuthContext`.
    *   Corrected a text content assertion for the "Status" field to match actual rendering (no space between label and value).

## Remaining Frontend Test Plan (Refined)

The original plan was very broad. Here's a refined view of what's likely remaining, keeping the MUI/Vite blocker in mind:

**Phase 4 (Continued): Detail Views & Other Non-Blocked Components**
*   **1. `itsm_frontend/src/modules/procurement/components/check-requests/CheckRequestDetailView.tsx` Tests:** **(Next Immediate Priority)**
    *   Locate the file.
    *   Analyze its functionality.
    *   Create `CheckRequestDetailView.test.tsx`.
    *   Implement tests (loading, error, not found, happy path data display, navigation/actions).
*   **2. `itsm_frontend/src/modules/service-requests/components/ServiceRequestDetailView.tsx`**
    *   Test if it exists and is not blocked by the MUI/Vite issue.
*   **3. `itsm_frontend/src/modules/inventory/components/AssetDetailView.tsx`**
    *   Test if it exists and is not blocked by the MUI/Vite issue.
*   **4. Other simple utility hooks or context providers** (if any were missed from initial analysis).

**Phase 5: Addressing MUI/Vite Blocker & Testing Affected Components**
*   **Crucial Step:** Investigate and fix the `Error: Directory import '/app/itsm_frontend/node_modules/@mui/material/styles' is not supported` issue. This is likely related to Vite configuration, MUI v5 ESM compatibility, or specific DataGrid/X components.
*   Once unblocked, implement tests for:
    *   `itsm_frontend/src/App.tsx` (Routing, theme, basic layout)
    *   `itsm_frontend/src/modules/service-requests/pages/ServiceRequestsPage.tsx` (DataGrid interactions, filtering, sorting, actions)
    *   `itsm_frontend/src/modules/service-requests/components/ServiceRequestForm.tsx` (Form interactions, validation, submission)
    *   Any other components that were previously blocked by this issue.

**Phase 6: Other Module Lists and Forms (Post MUI-Blocker Fix)**
*   Review other modules (e.g., Inventory, Knowledge Base, etc.) for key list and form components.
    *   Example: `AssetCategoryList.tsx`, `AssetCategoryForm.tsx`
    *   Example: `ServiceCatalogList.tsx`, `ServiceCatalogForm.tsx`
    *   Prioritize based on usage and complexity.

**Phase 7: Dashboard/Reporting Components**
*   Test any dashboard or reporting components. These might also be MUI-heavy and depend on the blocker fix.

**Phase 8: Final Review & Coverage Check**
*   Run the complete frontend test suite.
*   Generate a coverage report (`npx vitest run --coverage`).
*   Identify and address any significant gaps in critical functionality based on the report and manual review.
*   Ensure all helper functions and utility components are adequately tested.

## Instructions for Next Agent:

1.  **Start with this `REMAINING_PLAN.md` file.**
2.  **Current Code State:** The branch `ft/po-detail-view-tests-and-handoff` contains all fixes and tests for `PurchaseOrderDetailView.tsx` and previous components. This `REMAINING_PLAN.md` file will be added in a subsequent commit/branch.
3.  **Next Task:** Begin with **Phase 4, item 1: `itsm_frontend/src/modules/procurement/components/check-requests/CheckRequestDetailView.tsx` Tests.**
    *   Follow the standard procedure: analyze component, create test file, write tests for loading/error/happy path/navigation.
4.  If `CheckRequestDetailView` work is completed swiftly, proceed to other items in Phase 4.
5.  **MUI/Vite Blocker (Phase 5):** If you have expertise in Vite/MUI integration, tackling this blocker would be highly impactful as it unblocks a large portion of the remaining UI components. If not, continue with non-blocked components from Phase 4 and then Phase 6.

Good luck!
